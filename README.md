Author: Hannah Sophie Heinrichs

## Task

A simple version of the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) written with PsychoPy. This experiment is a computerized, laboratory-based measure that involves actual risky behavior for which, similar to real-world situations, riskiness is rewarded up until a point at which further riskiness results in poorer outcomes. Participants complete 90 trials where they pump a balloon and obtain money. With every pump a balloon wil explode with increasing probability (Lejuez et al. 2002). Subject and data will be seperately stored in txt files and can be matched by subject id.

## Description

A simple version of the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) written in PsychoPy.
Instructions are found in the png file "instructions". 
It will imports image and sound files from this foulder and create two txt files upon execution, one with information on subject and one containing the task data.
These can be merged by id (first coloumn) with commonly used software (e.g. R).
